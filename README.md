# Octagon-Oracle-UFC-Fight-Outcome-Predictor
The Octagon Oracle employs machine learning to predict UFC fight outcomes, using fighter profiles, historical match statistics, and previous results. This concise overview highlights the model's intent, data utilization, and analytical approach for forecasting fight winners.


# Abstract
The Octagon Oracle is a predictive analytics model designed to forecast outcomes in UFC fights. Utilizing historical data on fighters, fight statistics, and past fight outcomes, the model applies machine learning techniques to predict winners in future matchups. This abstract introduces the model's purpose, its data sources, and the predictive methodology employed.

# Introduction
Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), particularly the UFC, has seen a surge in popularity and complexity. Predicting fight outcomes in such a dynamic sport requires not only an understanding of the sport but also a deep dive into the data behind it. This paper introduces the Octagon Oracle, a model developed to predict UFC fight outcomes based on statistical analysis of past fight data and fighter attributes.

# Data Analysis
